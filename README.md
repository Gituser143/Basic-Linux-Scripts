# Basic Linux Scripts Along with one liners
One liners are in the one_liners.md file

Scripts to do those basic tasks that are quite tedious...
Keep these scripts in a custom bin folder and add this folder to $PATH

How to add this folder?   
```echo "export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/your/scripts" >> ~/.profile```

So here's how we write a script :

    #!/bin/bash
    #Enter your bash commands, lines preceeded with a '#' are comments.

# Scripts : 
* **dpkg_lock**: For the dpkg frontend lock error. Just run the script, but be cautious. Run it only if error is thrown.
* **update**: For full system update and upgrade. Just run, if dpkg lock error comes up, use the above script and then run.
* **bitlocker**: For decrypting and mounting devices. If dislocker is not installed, then run "apt install dislocker".
* **draw**: Used to run draw.io as root
* **idea**: Script generated by JetBrains
* **minecraft**: Run minecraft using TLauncher
* **notebook**: Run jupyter as root in Kali
* **vlc_root**: Allow VLC media player to run as root
* **vpn**: Custom OpenVPN config
* **space**: Display space usage
